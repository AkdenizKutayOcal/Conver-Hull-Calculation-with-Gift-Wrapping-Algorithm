# Convex-Hull-Calculation-with-Gift-Wrapping-Algorithm
This was a small school project of finding Convex Hull of given set of points by using Gift Wrapping Algorithm of Jarvis March.
Both C and JS files added to the file.

In mathematics, the convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex set that contains these
points. The convex hull may be visualized as the shape enclosed by a rubber band stretched
around these points (see the figure below). In this assignment, I computed the convex hull of a 
set of given points in a separate file (input.txt). For the given set of 14 points
below, you can find the 7 points on the right most column, through which the convex hull passes.
